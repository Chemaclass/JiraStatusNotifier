# Scrum Master   

This is the result of the SevenSenders #2 Hackaton.

We build a virtual Scrum Master to support the Product Managers in order to 
monitor the status progress of the current sprint tickets. 
Ensuring faster code review, QA and raising alerts based on SLA's.

You can modify the SLA's, so it can be used for multiple SCRUM teams in the company.
